This is the reverse of [Dec Array to Bin](https://github.com/rynho/Scripts/tree/main/DEC%20Array%20to%20Bin).

The PowerShell script is to convert a binary file into text file consisting of each byte represented by an array of its decimal value.
This is to be used by a C languate to embed files, which e.g., was used in ESP32-Server-900U.
